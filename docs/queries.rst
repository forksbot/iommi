Queries
=======

iommi queries makes it easy to implement searching and filtering in your Django app.

Major features:

- Generate simple filtering GUIs
- Supply your views with an advanced query language
- Query language can be used stand alone without the GUI parts
- Highly customizable GUI based on iommi :doc:`forms`

Queries are normally used from inside iommi tables where they are an
integrated part, but can also be used stand alone. See below for an
example.

Query language
--------------

iommi comes with an advanced query language so users can filter tables
after what they want. Searching songs can look like this:

.. code::

    album=Paranoid AND lyrics:"have the power"

This will find the song War Pigs, as it's from the album Paranoid and
the lyrics contains the text "have the power".   The query language supports
`AND` and `OR`, parenthesis and the operations `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` for
numerical values, and `=` for all values which is an exact case insensitive
match. You can exclude with `!=`. As the example above shows `:` is used for
case insensitive "contains" queries, and the inverse of that is `!:`

iommi tries to support what the user might intuitively write for searching
boolean columns. It will interpret "n", "no", "0" (zero), "false", "f" and "off"
as `false`  and the corresponding values for `true`.

You can configure a `Filter` to be case sensitive by setting `query_operator_to_q_operator`
to `case_sensitive_query_operator_to_q_operator`.

iommi queries have a special form for filtering directly on pk, which can be
very handy: `album.pk=3`.

`query_operator_for_field` specifies what operation the simple form uses to
interpret its inputs. The default is `=`, meaning exact case insensitive match.

If you have table of `Song` and a foreign key to `Album`, if you search for
`album=Paranoid` iommi will by default create the Django query
`Q(album__name='Paranoid')`. If your model has different fields used as names,
you must register those with `register_search_fields`, or if you want
something other special for just this view you can use the `search_fields`
parameter to specify the fields to use. Note that you can use `pk` or
other non-string columns as search fields if you want.


Stand alone example
-------------------

Simple view that allows the user to search for a car by choosing the make from a drop down, and search
for specific model in the advanced mode:

.. code:: python

    class CarQuery(Query):
        make = Filter.choice(
            choices=['Toyota', 'Volvo', 'Ford'],
            form_fields__include=True)  # Display this field in the simple style GUI
        model = Filter.text()

    def cars(request):
        query = CarQuery()
        query.bind(request=request)
        cars_query_set = query.get_q()
        return render(
            template_name='cars.html',
            context={
                'query': query,
                'cars': cars_query_set,
            },
        )


.. code:: html

    <!-- cars.html -->
    {{ query }}

    <ul>
        {% for car in cars %}
            <li>{{ car }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>

After switching to the advanced mode:

Programmatically call the search API:

.. code:: python

    query = CarQuery()
    cars_query_set = query.parse_query_string(
        'make=Toyota and (make=1991 or make=1992)'
    )
